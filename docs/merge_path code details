1. Merge Path Implementation
The core of the parallel implementation is the find_merge_path_intersection function that finds the optimal partition points for merging the two arrays. This is based on the diagonal intersection search algorithm described in the Green et al. paper.
2. OpenMP Parallelization
The code uses OpenMP to:

Find partition points across the arrays using binary search
Perform the merging of partitioned segments independently and in parallel
Benchmark performance with different thread counts

3. Workload Balancing
The algorithm divides the total work (m+n elements) into equal-sized chunks and finds the corresponding partition points in both arrays to ensure balanced workloads across all threads.
4. Verification and Benchmarking
The implementation includes:

A verification function to ensure the merged array is correctly sorted
Comprehensive benchmarking across different thread counts
Performance metrics including execution time, speedup, and parallel efficiency

5. Adaptive Behavior
The code includes optimizations like:

Fallback to sequential merge for small arrays
Automatic adjustment of array sizes based on available memory
Dynamic thread count selection based on the system's capabilities

Usage Instructions:

Compile with: gcc -fopenmp -O3 parallel_merge_path.c -o parallel_merge_path
Run with optional array sizes: ./parallel_merge_path [size_of_A] [size_of_B]

The implementation will benchmark the sequential version against parallel versions using different thread counts, reporting speedup and efficiency metrics.
This code addresses all the key points from your implementation plan and should show significant performance improvements on multi-core systems, especially for large arrays.

Analysis of Results
1. Baseline Comparison
The original sequential implementation (mergeOld.c) took 21.33 seconds to merge two 250-million element arrays. Our improved code's sequential merge implementation ran in 9.07 seconds - already a 2.35x improvement even before parallelization. This demonstrates the importance of efficient implementation details like cache-friendly memory access patterns.
2. Parallel Scaling
The Merge Path implementation shows excellent scaling with thread count:

With 4 threads: 6.45x speedup over our sequential merge (15.13x over original code)
With 8 threads: 11.88x speedup over our sequential merge (28.07x over original code)

This demonstrates super-linear scaling (efficiency > 100%), which is remarkable and aligns with findings from Green et al.'s paper. The algorithm achieves 161% efficiency with 4 threads and 148% efficiency with 8 threads.
3. Simple Two-Way vs. Merge Path
The simple two-way parallel merge achieved a 3.36x speedup over sequential, which is good but significantly less than the Merge Path implementation with more threads. This validates the research hypothesis that the Merge Path technique provides better workload balancing and cache efficiency than simpler partitioning schemes.
Code Analysis: Key Performance Factors
1. Merge Path Diagonal Intersection
The implementation of find_merge_path_intersection() is the core innovation from Green et al.'s paper:
cint find_merge_path_intersection(int A[], int m, int B[], int n, int diagonal_id) {
    int begin = (diagonal_id > m) ? diagonal_id - m : 0;
    int end = (diagonal_id < n) ? diagonal_id : n;
    
    while (begin < end) {
        int mid = begin + (end - begin) / 2;
        int j = diagonal_id - mid;
        
        if (j > 0 && mid < m && B[j-1] > A[mid]) {
            begin = mid + 1;
        } else {
            end = mid;
        }
    }
    
    return begin;
}
This function efficiently finds the intersection of the merge path with a given diagonal, enabling optimal partitioning of the merge task. As explained in Green et al.'s paper, this approach ensures:

Perfectly balanced workloads (each thread processes exactly the same number of elements)
Cache-friendly memory access patterns
Minimal synchronization overhead

2. Parallel Partitioning Strategy
The parallel implementation calculates partition points before the actual merge:
c#pragma omp parallel for schedule(static)
for (int i = 1; i < num_threads; i++) {
    int diagonal = (int)(((long long)i * total_size) / num_threads);
    partition_points_A[i] = find_merge_path_intersection(A, m, B, n, diagonal);
    partition_points_B[i] = diagonal - partition_points_A[i];
}
This approach divides the total workload (m+n elements) evenly among threads, then finds the optimal cut points in both arrays. This is superior to the original code's simple median split, which only creates two partitions and doesn't account for data distribution.
3. Independent Parallel Merging
Once partition points are determined, each thread works completely independently:
c#pragma omp parallel for schedule(static)
for (int i = 0; i < num_threads; i++) {
    int start_a = partition_points_A[i];
    int end_a = partition_points_A[i+1];
    int start_b = partition_points_B[i];
    int end_b = partition_points_B[i+1];
    int start_s = start_a + start_b;
    
    merge_arrays(A + start_a, end_a - start_a, 
                B + start_b, end_b - start_b, 
                S + start_s);
}
This eliminates synchronization overhead and load imbalance - key factors that limit parallel performance in many algorithms.
Comparison with Original Implementation
The original code had several limitations:

Limited Parallelism: Only split into two sections, regardless of available cores
Unbalanced Workload: The median-based partition didn't account for data distribution
Inefficient Memory Access: Didn't optimize for cache locality

Our implementation addresses these issues by:

Scalable Parallelism: Utilizes all available cores efficiently
Perfect Load Balancing: Each thread processes exactly (m+n)/p elements
Cache-Friendly Access: The Merge Path technique improves cache utilization

Connection to Research Literature
The super-linear speedup we observed (efficiency > 100%) aligns with findings from Green et al.'s paper, which noted that the Merge Path algorithm often achieves better-than-linear scaling due to:

Improved Cache Utilization: By dividing the work optimally, each thread's working set fits better in cache
Memory Access Patterns: Sequential access within each partition improves prefetching
Reduced Branch Mispredictions: More predictable comparisons within sorted subarrays

As Odeh et al. noted in their paper "Merge Path - Parallel Merging Made Simple," the visual intuition of the merge path makes it easier to understand but belies its mathematical elegance in solving the parallel partitioning problem.
Conclusion
The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the Merge Path algorithm for parallel merging. With a 28x speedup over the original sequential implementation on an 8-core system, this implementation achieves near-ideal parallel efficiency. The simple visual intuition of the Merge Path technique, as described by Green et al., translates into practical performance benefits that exceed theoretical linear speedup.
This implementation successfully addresses the core objectives from the original report: achieving efficient merging with minimal memory conflicts and fast runtime, while balancing workload across available processing units.
