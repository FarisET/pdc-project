1. Merge Path Implementation
The core of the parallel implementation is the find_merge_path_intersection function that finds the optimal partition points for merging the two arrays. This is based on the diagonal intersection search algorithm described in the Green et al. paper.
2. OpenMP Parallelization
The code uses OpenMP to:

Find partition points across the arrays using binary search
Perform the merging of partitioned segments independently and in parallel
Benchmark performance with different thread counts

3. Workload Balancing
The algorithm divides the total work (m+n elements) into equal-sized chunks and finds the corresponding partition points in both arrays to ensure balanced workloads across all threads.
4. Verification and Benchmarking
The implementation includes:

A verification function to ensure the merged array is correctly sorted
Comprehensive benchmarking across different thread counts
Performance metrics including execution time, speedup, and parallel efficiency

5. Adaptive Behavior
The code includes optimizations like:

Fallback to sequential merge for small arrays
Automatic adjustment of array sizes based on available memory
Dynamic thread count selection based on the system's capabilities
